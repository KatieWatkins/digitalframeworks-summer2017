Massachusetts is a state with a strong connection to the past. The National Park Service has recognized the state's natural beauty and historical importance with over a dozen national parks, historic parks, and national seashores, totalling more than 10 million visitors in 2016. No citizen of the bay state needs the data to know which is the most popular, though. They're too busy putting on their Sox caps, filling up their tanks, and heading east for a weekend on the Cape.
