# Digital Frameworks Final Project

## Due Date

August 25, 2017

## Requirements

The goal of this project is to show that you are able to find a dataset that interests you and use it to tell a story.

1. 1000 words, or 800 words and a visualization
1. Must rely on your analysis of at least one data set.
1. Must be newsworthy. I know this is vague, but I don’t just want a list of 6 stats you found in your dataset. Tell me a story.
1. In addition to the story, please write 200 words about your process. Tell me why you were interested, where you found your data, and what you did to turn it into a story. 

## Grading

Here are the criteria I will use to grade you:

1. Did you complete the assignment as described?
1. Did you use the data comprehensively (ie you really dug in, you didn’t just pull 1 or 2 topline numbers)
1. Did you make the story relevant in a way I wanted to read?


## Submitting

Submit it as finalproject.md on github

UNLESS you want to put it on an existing blog or website, in which case please still make a file called finalproject.md, and put a link in there.

## Questions

Please get in touch early if you have questions about the project or want to know if an idea you have is on the right track.
